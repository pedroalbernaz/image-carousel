          "description": "​Awesome makeup hacks\n\nMakeup came into our lives to make it even more beautiful. We all go online to watch our favorite makeup tutorials, learn the latest contouring tips and ways to do our makeup in less than 5 minutes. We know the struggles that I girl might go through when it comes to doing her makeup. So, we created these video compilation with tips and tricks to look stunning in just minutes with minimum makeup.\n\n1. How to quickly fix your frizzy hair:\n- Separate your hair into two parts from the middle. Then, take each part of your hair and twist/swirl it. After that, turn on your hair straightener and run it through the two swirls you just made with your hair. Finally, let go and there you have it. Wavy curls that took you less than 5 minutes. \n\n2. DIY travel makeup.\n- If you are going places that you need to take your trusted makeup with you but you do not have any space for it. Here is what you need to do. Cut some tracing paper, swatch your eyeshadows, blushers, bronzer, highlighter and all your powdered makeup products on your tracing paper. Then fold it and take it with you. This way you don't have to carry your palettes and everything you need to touch-up your look. \n\n3. How to remove undereye circles\n- Did you just wake up, looked yourself in the mirror and noticed those purple looking undereye circles. Do not panic. Here is what you need to do. Take a bowl and fill it with lukewarm water. Add two tea-bags of green tea and let them brew. After 3-4 minutes take the teabags out and place them on your eyes for 10 minutes. When you take them off you'll see that the dark circles disappeared.\n\n4. How to remove your makeup with natural products.\n- Here is the thing. We've all been through that phase where we didn't have a makeup remover around and we ended up sleeping with a full face of makeup on. But you can try any of these products to remove your makeup naturally. Such as Olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, vitamin E oil.!\n\n5. How to make your own brow gel:\n- Not only this makeup hack will work wonders on your brows, but it will also promote hair growth and make your brows look like they been done by a professional. Here is what you need to do. Take a small container (a container for an eye cream for example) fill it with pure Aloe Vera gel, then, scrape some eyeshadow that matches your brow color, or a brow powder and mix it with the Aloe Vera gel.\n\n6. How to re-purpose Empty makeup containers.\nIf you run out of your makeup product or you are about to run out, there are many ways to re-purpose it:\n- You can take all your lip-glosses that are about to run out and place them in a small travel palette to have on the go.\n- You can take one of your blushers or highlighters that just run out and place inside one small dose of your favorite eyeshadow to turn it into a brand new highlighter with a combination of shades. Then add some rubbing alcohol and press it using a coin and some paper towels. It will be like you are having a whole highlighting palette in a small container.\n- If you think you are running out of your lip-gloss. Before you go and get a new one. Just boil some water and pour it into a cup. Then, place your lip-gloss inside and let it sit for 5 minutes.\n- If you are running out of your mascara, add a few drops of contact lens solution inside. Then shake well and see the results.\n\n7. How to organize and never lose your earrings.\n- This one is a genius hack especially if you are one of those people who misplace one of their earrings more often than they should. Take a few large buttons and place your earrings through them. This way you'll never lose one and they'll always be in pairs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTimestamps: \n1:05 - DIY makeup samples on the go\n1:32 - Make any lipstick waterproof\n2:12 - Perfect winged liner for beginners\n2:30 - How to get rid of undereye circles\n2:55 - DIY makeup remover\n3:40 - DIY brow gel\n5:32 - Adjustable makeup brush\n6:10 - Empty makeup hacks\n7:05 - How to make your own Highlighter\n7:58 - How to fix dry mascara\n8:18 - DIY glitter eyeshadow palette\n10:56 - Makeup travel hack - prevent leakage\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/\n\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/5Minute.Crafts.Girly/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/5m_crafts\n\nSubscribe to 5-Minute MAGIC: http://bit.ly/2ldditZ\n5-Minute Crafts KIDS: https://goo.gl/PEuLVt\n\nThe Bright Side of Youtube: https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/",

Does she have two clits and like two whole things up there or does it eventually turn into one thing, like when she goes to the gynecologist which one do they put the thingy thing up to swab or like how does that fucking work?  I'm just filled with questions that I feel like I never got the answer to, so I wish that I didn't know it existed because I have just been riddled with all of these thoughts and feelings about her vagina and now I'm just hanging with no answers, her vagina is like the universe and I'm just trying so hard to understand it but I don't have the answers and I keep asking God like, can you explain this to me?  And then he doesn't answer back because I'm supposed to figure it out myself but that takes so long and is so ",

Hatsune Miku.\n\nYou're looking at her, and this video can show you how to look like her. This video would work well for those who want to dress up like Miku at her concerts, anime events and expos and more! ( fyi, Miku doesn't wear hairbands, but I had to wear a few because I was in the desert filming this scene. It was so windy, my hair was flapping everywhere and getting all tangled. How did Rapunzel do it?! Seriously!)\n\nHatsune Miku is a vocaloid, she's not an anime or hologram,  this video explains it pretty well and shows you how to use the vocaloid program. It may seem new to you, but it's been around in Japan for a while. Very cool stuff. http://youtu.be/SIOr5UWxPz0\n\nIf you wanna check out really cool Hatsune Miku cosplay, you can find a lot on Google Image!  I saw a bunch when I went to Akihabara while I was in Japan last week! Even men dress up like her, I was shocked! Haha!\n\n♥ Please Subscribe! http://bit.ly/MPs",

New Slaves is dope, so is Blood on the Leaves, like when the beat drops in Blood on the Leaves it is VERRRRRYYYY exciting if you had not had that experience yet, you should go have it.  Everyone likes to take doodoos on Kanye because he's insane and yeah some of his lyrics are pretty confusical but you know what?
